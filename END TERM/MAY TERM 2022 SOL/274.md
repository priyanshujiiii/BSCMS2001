<h2><div>The A/B testing method determines which of two versions of something produces the best results. It’s often referred to as “split testing” because groups of users are split into two groups (the “A” group and the “B” group) and funneled into separate digital experiences.</div>

<div>An A/B test can help you craft better-performing marketing campaigns or tweak product onboarding workflows. Changes to your product or feature can be tested on small, segmented groups called cohorts to verify effectiveness while minimizing friction.</div></h2>
